    <h3>What is Ramen ?</h3>
    <p>If you have ever wanted to make Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you. This everyday meal is great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. To save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.  
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons spicy sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
        <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tablespoons bonito soup stock</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li>
        <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
